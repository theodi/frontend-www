Following this he joined a project with the Cabinet Office using natural language processing to automatically recommend relevant government procurement contracts to companies in the UK.

For five minutes each day, Grace asks users questions about their challenges, confidence, positivity and how useful they have felt the day has been. Users can then explore the data they record in weekly, customised emails and a personalisable online dashboard. </p>\n\n<p>Plexus also uses machine learning to direct users to its knowledge base, which aggregates data sourced from over 25 different government services, NGOs and charities including <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/?gclid=CJqh3vmY3swCFQUq0wodfV4ETQ\">Mind</a>, Martin Lewis&rsquo;s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/\">Money Saving Expert</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/donate/100khomelesschildren?gclid=CJ6g6I2Z3swCFbYK0wod-tYNyw\">Shelter</a>. Open data sits at the heart of this process, from supporting users learn to helping develop Grace&rsquo;s ability to understand and predict. A primary goal for Plexus is to produce meaningful open datasets that have the power to shape service provision on a regional and national level.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/friday-lunchtime-lecture-meet-grace-a-bot-to-boost-your-wellbeing-at-work-tickets-25476929181?ref=ebtn\"><img src=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/custombutton?eid=25476929181\" /></a></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>About Martin Vowles</h3>\n\n<p><em>Martin Vowles is Creative Director &amp; co-Founder of M/A and also CEO of Plexus.

The problem is, the global population is expanding and companies like North Pole Inc. everywhere are being forced to find new, more efficient ways of delivering services. </p>\n\n<p>This year, a crack team at North Pole Inc. has been working on developing and implementing the data infrastructure that Christmas needs, to keep children happy for years to come. </p>\n\n<p>Join us on 18 December to hear from North Pole Inc. <strong>CEO, Santa Claus; Head of Deliveries, Reiner Deerdale and Chief Elf Envisioner Sparkle Wonderdust</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>Look out for surprise guests!</p>\n\n<p><small class=\"pull-right\"><i>Photo: Flickr -<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregloby/3083873075/in/photolist-vWbF2G-iAwxWa-M6Qq1-fKBtV6-cpCkU-bRTWGn-4NpR81-7LNe1H-o1mFkN-rxwUBe-55GvQS-nrJbzn-93UEHF-6wKAPE-4DPCva-5GSnPt-4G6pp9-6mTTHR-hub9f-dyJ7de-qUiG12-5yMWoC-ziJkU9-e9r6yc-d3ycyu-cKrx1W-4oo77A-iz7Jw1-yaSnk-rRRMKF-6VAyq-e582An-aGhST-qjNVG2-4gxNTE-oMjSM6-fZoiTS-iqNVRR-ixVBiS-pda55o-5GvE2r-qp8u73-qa9sHx-ziKsnq-rWRtow-iaXnrH-9MHnEM-gUWopL-61tSB5-86iYQS\"> Greg Lobinski (CC-BY-2.0)</a></i></small></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Book your place</h3>\n\n<iframe src=\"//eventbrite.co.uk/tickets-external?eid=19800719485&amp;ref=etckt\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"214\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>About our Friday lunchtime lectures</h3>\n\n<p>With a broad range of topics in open data such as tracking government expenditure, British landscape mapping and creating art, there\u2019s bound to be something that interests you. </p>\n\n<p>The sessions run from 1pm to 1.45pm weekly during UK school term-times, with informal networking until 2pm.

Even he was surprised by some of his findings.</p>\n\n<p><em>Jonathan is an Associate Trainer at the ODI. He was a journalist and editor as well as Head of Training at BBC World Service until 2010.
